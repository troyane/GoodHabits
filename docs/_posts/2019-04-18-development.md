Part of the day spent mostly on development of core:
* still, lots of Felgo documentation reads, 
* polishing the idea of application,
* rewrite logic of application for usage of local storage
* review of used datastructures, polishing backup and load
* lot of joy to use FilterSortProxyModel
* implement a way to handle unique ids (something like UUID)

**P.S.:** 

Sometimes Felgo QtCreator behave quite strange. For example, there is a lack in documentation. 
E.g. I can't find documentation article via Lokator (Ctrl+k) `NativeUtils`.
