# Good Habits

The Good Habits app is created to cultivate new and useful endeavors and make this process joyful and simple.

People are trying to improve themselves everyday. But as at the school desk, we're getting tired sometimes or bored or feeling absent. Good Habits is like good omens of the right way people are walking.

This app helps people to understand how much time do they spend on their hobbies and interests, how sustainable their wishes and aims are and where the habit starts to benefit you in the new skills form. And the one effect we're expecting is that being motivated to spend more time on good habits, you won't spend time on bad habits...
